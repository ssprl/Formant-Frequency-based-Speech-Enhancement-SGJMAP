# Smartphone based real time Super Gaussian Speech enhancement to improve intelligibility for hearing aid users using formant information.

## Overview
This GitHub repository provides for Speech enhancement on iOS smartphone platforms. The example app provided here is for hearing improvement studies. 

> **Abstract:** In this paper, we present a Speech Enhancement (SE) technique to improve intelligibility of speech perceived by Hearing Aid users using smartphone as an assistive device. We use the formant frequency information to improve the overall quality and intelligibility of the speech. The proposed SE method is based on new super Gaussian joint maximum a Posteriori (SGJMAP) estimator. Using the priori information of formant frequency locations, the derived gain function has “tradeoff” factors that allows the smartphone user to customize perceptual preference, by controlling the amount of noise suppression and speech distortion in real-time. The formant frequency information helps the hearing aid user to control the gains over the non-formant frequency band, allowing the HA users to attain more noise suppression while maintaining the speech intelligibility using a smartphone application. Objective intelligibility measures and subjective results reflect the usability of the developed SE application in noisy real world acoustic environment.
